# org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.ClosedStatus version 1

## Theory of Operation

This interface provides the status of any object that can report a two state 
open/closed condition.  It can be a stand alone door or window, or a opening to
a larger device such as a refrigerator door.
The _producer_ has one or more openings that can Open/Close and implements a 
separate interface for each one.  The _consumer_ is an application that is 
interested in the state of the opening.  Possibly to provide an email or push 
notification to a consumer it is open at an unexpected time or for an excessive 
duration.  (The consumer notification portion of the use case is outside the 
scope of AllJoyn CDM.)
