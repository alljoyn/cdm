## Battery Powered Theory of Operation version 1

This theory of operation explains the interaction between interfaces that are common to battery powered devices.

### Overview

A battery powered device is defined as a device that can have all or some of its functionality powered by a battery. At a minimum, a battery powered 
device should implement _BatteryStatus_. This document also specifies how the _BatteryStatus_ interface should interact with the _Alerts_ interface.

### A Simple Device

#### org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.BatteryStatus

This interface can be used to provide the capability to monitor the current power level of the battery. It also exposes the capability to monitor the 
charging status of a battery. If the battery cannot be recharged then the _IsCharging_ property should always remain false.

### A more complex device

#### Add org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.Alerts

This interface can be used to raise alerts generated by the device.  

When the battery power level is low, the _Alerts_ interface should be used to emit a "battery low" warning.  
If the powered device contains a back-up battery (i.e., for redundancy when using main power), a warning should be emitted when the back-up battery
becomes active.
