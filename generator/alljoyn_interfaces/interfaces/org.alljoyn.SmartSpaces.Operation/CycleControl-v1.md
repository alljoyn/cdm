# org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.CycleControl version 1

## Theory of Operation

This interface provides capability:
  * to get information about operational state of an appliance
  * to control appliance with a specific set of commands linked to appliance
    operational state.

Starting from following definitions:

  * the appliance **cycle** is a
    * user- or manufacture-preset sequence of operation
    * so that each operation of the sequence involves its starting and ending
      times or a duration
    * therefore the entire cycle sequence also involves its starting and ending
      times or a duration
  * the **cycle selection** is an
    * action of the user to customize cycles

the appliances can be organized in two categories:

  * **Cyclic Operations Devices**: devices that aim to accomplish cycles
    (e.g. washers, ovens, ...)
  * **Non-Cyclic Operations Devices**: devices that have no cycles (e.g.
    fridges, freezers, ...)

The operational state of **Non-Cyclic Operations Devices** can be just on and
off, so is fully described in the **org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.OnOffStatus**
interface.
On the other hand **Cyclic Operations Devices** has more complex operational
state, so the on/off management is integrated with the features described below
by this interface.

The list of generic operational state values for **Cyclic Operations Devices**
and their meaning is the following:

  * **Idle** --- cycle selection is unfinished, the device can not start to
    execute any operation because of no selected cycle or similar reasons; it
    also includes the case of the robot cleaner when it is being charged, but
    the battery level is not above threshold to start its cleaning operation
  * **Working** --- the device is executing its peculiar operation
  * **ReadyToStart** --- the cycle has been selected and the device is waiting
    for the explicit start command from the user to execute it
  * **DelayedStart** --- the execution of the cycle is being delayed until the
    specified time elapses
  * **Paused** --- the device is in pause, its operation is on hold
  * **EndOfCycle** --- the device has completed a cycle and waits for user
    acknowledge or time-out to move to the next state, typically
    **ReadyToStart** or **Idle**; the device can make some post-cycle operations
    in this state, e.g. buzzing, ...

The remote controller can monitor the value of the state and can stimulate the
change of the state by sending the following operational commands:

  * **Start**
  * **Stop**
  * **Pause**
  * **Resume**

The above list of operational states and commands cover the most general case.
A particular appliance implementation supports just a subset of them.

All states transitions depending on the received commands are listed below: they
are described as generic cases, anyway the specific devices can refuse commands
for functional reason (e.g. for safety reason a device could not support the
start from remote ...):

  * transitions from **Idle** state

    * a **cycle selection** makes a transition to the **ReadyToStart** state:
      it can be accomplished in one of the following ways:
      * locally on the local UI of the device (at a first glance it can be not
        convenient selecting the cycle locally and then activate it remotely;
        anyway for these kind of devices a manual interaction is requested with
        the cycle selection, e.g. putting clothes or dishes in the washers,
        putting food in the oven ...)
      * remotely using a another interface; the remote procedures to select
        cycle remotely are defined in specific interfaces, because they involve
        the usage of parameters and options that are really peculiar to the
        device type
      when the device is in **Idle** state the controller can suggest or
      recommend that the user select the cycle (e.g. a dedicated message on a
      remote App) acting locally or remotely

  * transitions from **Working** state

    * **Stop** command on "Cyclic Operations Devices" stops the operation,
      resulting state depends on device
    * **Pause** command makes a transition to the **Paused** state

  * transitions from **ReadyToStart** state

    * **Start** command starts the selected operation, the resulting state can
      be **Working** or **DelayedStart** depending on device and selected cycle
      options

  * transitions from **DelayedStart** state

    * **Stop** command cancels the delay, resulting state depends on device
    * **Pause** command pauses the delay counter, so it can be resumed later (it
      is a "Pause from Delay"), and makes a transition to the **Paused** state
      back

  * transitions from **Paused** state

    * **Stop** command removes pending operation, resulting state depends on
      device
    * **Resume** command restores the prior state, and makes a transition to the
      **Working** or **DelayedStart** state

  * transitions from **EndOfCycle** state

    * **Stop** command cancels post-cycle operations, resulting state depends on
      device
    * the device can exit from **EndOfCycle** by local interaction or
      autonomously (e.g. after a timeout); consider that for these kind of
      devices a manual interaction is requested at the end of the cycle (e.g.
      removing clothes from the washers or food from the oven)

The following figure summarizes the state transitions, anyway it is not
comprehensive of all the cases which can be covered by appliances.

| Annotation | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = const |

It indicates which are the supported operational states by the specific
appliance. A device may support just a subset of operational states, depending
on its type (e.g. a fridge does not support **Pause** state, ...) or on specific
implementation.

The data type is an enumeration and the allowed values are the same of
**OperationalState** property list.

#### SupportedOperationalCommands

|            |                                                          |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Type       | byte[]                                                   |
| Access     | read-only                                                |
| Annotation | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = const |

It indicates which are the supported operational commands by the appliance. A
device may support just a subset of operational commands, depending on its type
(e.g. a fridge does not support **Pause** command, ...), on the current
appliance operational state or on specific implementation.

The data type is an enumeration and its allowed value are listed below:

  * 0 --- **Start** --- see "Theory of Operation"
  * 1 --- **Stop** --- see "Theory of Operation"
  * 2 --- **Pause** --- see "Theory of Operation"
  * 3 --- **Resume** --- see "Theory of Operation"

### Methods

#### ExecuteOperationalCommand(command)

Execute an operational command. After getting the supported operational states
and the supported operational commands, a valid operational command should be
chosen out of the supported commands list. If a _producer_ device receives an
invalid operational command or can not execute a valid command due to its
internal operational state, then appropriate errors shall be returned.

Input arguments:

  * **command** --- byte --- operational command to be executed, the data type
    are an enumeration and the allowed values are the same of the
    **SupportedOperationalCommands** property list.

Errors raised by this method:
  * org.alljoyn.Error.InvalidValue --- if the command value is not one of the
    **SupportedOperationalCommands** list
  * org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.NotAcceptableDueToInternalState --- when the
    command value is not accepted by the _producer_, because it is in a state
    which doesn't allow the resulting transition
  * org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.RemoteControlDisabled --- when the remote
    control is disabled

### Signals

No signals are emitted by this interface.

### Interface Errors

The method calls in this interface use the AllJoyn error message handling
feature (`ER_BUS_REPLY_IS_ERROR_MESSAGE`) to set the error name and error
message. The table below lists the possible errors raised by this interface.

| Error name                                                    | Error message                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| org.alljoyn.Error.InvalidValue                                | Invalid value                                     |
| org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.NotAcceptableDueToInternalState | The value is not acceptable due to internal state |
| org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.RemoteControlDisabled           | Remote control disabled                           |

## Examples

### Example 1

The following sequence describes an example of a refused operational command
from appliance.

1. appliance state executing a cycle:
  * the appliance operation state is **working**

2. the remote _consumer_ tries to start the appliance:
  * the appliance receives a **Start** command; it is refused because of its
  internal state (appliance is already working), The error reported is
  **org.alljoyn.Cdm.Error.NotAcceptableDueToInternalState**
