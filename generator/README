The generate.py script automatically generates the code for the interface and model
layers of CDM.  These include

    cpp/interfaces/
    samples/DeviceEmulator/Models/
    samples/QController/interfaces/

The code is generated using the XML files in the alljoyn_interfaces repo.
This should be in $AJ_ROOT/alljoyn_interfaces.
The code is generated using Jinja2 templates in the templates/interface_templates directory.
In templates/patches* there are hand-crafted patches for the generated code.

The generation process is controlled by the Makefile. Normally you would generate into
a local tree, output/ or output_tcl. The code can then be installed into the source tree.

To generate and install everything for standard CDM do
    make generate install

To generate and install everything for standard CDM do
    make which=tcl generate install

The model code can be generated separately using
    make generate_samples install_samples
or
    make which=tcl generate_samples install_samples
