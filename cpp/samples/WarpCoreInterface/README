This sample demonstrates how to use the code generator to quickly implement a new interface.


Step 1: Using the WarpCore-v1.xml file in this directory generate all the interface code.

  As an example, from this directory in a terminal enter:

../../../generator/generate.py ../../../generator/templates/interface_templates/cdm WarpCore-v1.xml --output ./output --binding cpp --components common controllee controller samples

  This create all the files required in the ./output directory.


Step 2: The controllee side

  Copy all the all the relevant controllee and common files the your controllee directory
  This step involves a bit of digging through the output directory due to the nature of the template setup of the
  generator for the CDM interfaces.

  You need these files from the interfaces inc and src dirs:
    common
        WarpCoreInterface.h
        WarpCoreInterface.cc
    controllee
        WarpCoreIntfControllee.h
        WarpCoreIntfControlleeImpl.cc
        WarpCoreIntfControlleeModel.h

  You need these files from the samples/DeviceEmulator
        WarpCoreModel.h
        WarpCoreModel.cc


  Notes:
    You might need to modify some header paths in the above files.
    In the Common/WarpCoreInterface.h change the return of GetInterfaceType() from WARP_CORE_INTERFACE to VENDOR_DEFINED_INTERFACE

  You should now have the interfaces that can be used in an app.


Step 3: The controller side

   * This will depend on the controller app being used. It is assumed here the QController is being used.

  From the generated output dir, under samples/QController, grab org_USSEnterprise_Engineering_WarpCore.h and org_USSEnterprise_Engineering_WarpCore.cpp
  and put them in the samples/QController/interfaces directory.

  Also copy from the interfaces directory the common and controller files.
  The includes might need to be corrected.

  In the QController/commoncontrollerroot.cpp include: WarpCoreInterface.h and WarpCoreIntfController.h
  At the bottom of the CommonControllerRoot constructor, call controller->RegisterInterface(WarpCoreInterface::INTERFACE_NAME, WarpCoreIntfController::CreateInterface);
