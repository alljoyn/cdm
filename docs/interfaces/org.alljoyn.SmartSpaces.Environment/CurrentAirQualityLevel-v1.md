# org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Environment.CurrentAirQualityLevel version 1

## Theory of Operation

This information provides represented air quality level measured by a 
device.
Examples of devices which may include this interface are air purifier and 
air quality monitor.
If the sensor is capable of detecting CHO2/CO2/CO/PM2.5/PM/VOC in ppm or 
ug/m3, it is recommended to use the CurrentAirQuality interface rather 
than CurrentAirQualityLevel.

The qualitative representation of current air quality level.

0 ~ MaxLevel:

* **0** --- **the cleanest level**
* **MaxLevel** --- **the most impure level**

For example, a device that only has 2 states clean and dirty would have 
MaxLevel = 1, and represented levels {0, 1}.
If there were 6 levels of detectability then MaxLevel = 5, and
represented levels would be {0(cleanest), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5(dirtiest)}.

#### MaxLevel

| Access     | read-only                                                      |
