# org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.RapidMode version 1

## Theory of Operation

Interface that exposes the Rapid (or Turbo) mode.  This is the opposite of 
ResourceSaving, the device works in a more aggressive mode, usually at an 
efficiency or noise level penalty.  This interface is appropriate for a device 
that has On/Off control of Rapid Mode.  RapidModeTimed is for a device that 
wants to provide more explicit control of the duration of RapidMode to a
controller.  No guidance is provided on managing the dependancies if both are
implemented.

| Annotation        | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = true |

The EmitsChangedSignal of this property should be modified to const once that 
feature is available.

#### RapidMode

|            |                                                              |

| Access     | read-write                                                   |
| Annotation | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = true      |

True if the device is currently operating in rapid mode.

Errors raised by the set method of this property:

* org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.NotAcceptableDueToInternalState --- Indicates
that the given value was not acceptable due to internal state.
* org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.RemoteControlDisabled --- Indicates that
control from a remote site is currently disabled.   See the
RemoteControl property in the [RemoteControllability interface](/org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation/RemoteControllability-v1) for 
further information.
