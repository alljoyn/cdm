# org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.ClosedStatus version 1

## Theory of Operation


This interface provides the status of any object that can report a two state 
open/closed condition.  It can be a stand alone door or window, or a opening to
a larger device such as a refrigerator door.
The _producer_ has one or more openings that can Open/Close and implements a 
separate interface for each one.  The _consumer_ is an application that is 
interested in the state of the opening.  Possibly to provide an email or push 
notification to a consumer it is open at an unexpected time or for an excessive 
duration.  (The consumer notification portion of the use case is outside the 
scope of AllJoyn HAE.)

### Properties

#### Version

|                   |                                                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Type              | uint16                                                  |
| Access            | read-only                                               |
| Annotation        | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = true |

The EmitsChangedSignal of this property should be updated to "const" once that 
feature is available in Core.

#### IsClosed

|                       |                                                                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type                  | boolean                                                               |
| Access                | read-only                                                             |
| Annotation            | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = true               |

True indicates that device is closed, false indicates the device is open.
