# org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.FilterStatus version 1

## Theory of Operation


This interface provides the status of a filter.  It is intended to be part of a 
larger object that might have multiple filters.  Example a refrigerator with a 
water filter and odor filter.
The _producer_ has one or more filters and implements a separate interface for 
each filter.  The _consumer_ is an application that is interested in the state 
of the filter.  Possibly to provide an email or push notification to a consumer 
when a filter needs to be replaced.  (The consumer notification portion of the 
use case is outside the scope of AllJoyn HAE).

Holds static information about the fiter.  Should change to const in 16.04

| Annotation            | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = true               |

Lifespan Remaining in percentage (100 - 0).  0 indicates replace/clean. 
A simple device may just implement 100/0 or  100/OrderPercent/0 instead of 
implementing the entire range of values

### Methods

No methods are defined for this interface.

### Signals

No signals are emitted by this interface.

### Named Types

#### struct FilterData

* **filterLifeInDays --- UInt16
* **isCleanable  --- boolean
* **orderPercentage --- byte
* **filterManufacturer** --- string
* **filterPartNumber** --- string
* **filterUrl** --- string

   
Static property provides filter information.
* filterLifeInDays is the manufacturers expected time between cleaning/
replacement.  Used to convert percentage into days remaining. 0xFFFF indicate no 
life estimate available.  0 indicates <1 day.
* isCleanable  a boolean signal if true at 0% remaining life filter can be 
cleaned and re-installed.
* orderPercentage is the life remaining at which it is recommended that a new
filter be ordered.  It can have a value of 0 because the filter is cleanable, or 
becuase the remaining life is unpredictable, for example a psid switch.
* filterManufacturer & filterPartNumber act as a tuple to determine type of 
filter.  A null string is acceptable.
* Url can be just a domain or a complete URL to the exact filter.  It may provide
additionl information of a site for ordering.  A null string is acceptable.


### Interface Errors

No errors are raised by this interface
