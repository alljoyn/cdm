# org.alljoyn.Hae.Device.ClotesWasherDryer version 1

## Theory of Operation

Clothes Washer-Dryers is a home appliance used to wash and dry laundry in the same
cavity, such as clothing and sheets. It integrate functionalities of Clothes Washers and
Clothes Dryers.
This interface provides capabilities to interact with specific functions and
resources of Clothes Washer-Dryers.

Those devices share similar features with other of the clothes washing and
drying area/cluster, which are Clothes Dryers and Clothes Washers.

The followings are minimum required shared interfaces for Clothes Washer-Dryers.

  * **org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.Control** --- for monitoring and
  controlling the appliance operational state

Some Clothes Washer-Dryers have also capabilities allowing:

  * to monitor and control the time of operations
  * to communicate the status of the alerts
  * to monitor and control the water temperature level
  * to monitor and control the clothes moisture level

in those cases following shared interface are implemented:

  * **org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.Timer** --- for monitoring and
    controlling the appliance operational times
  * **org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Operation.Alerts** --- to communicate alerts
  * **org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Environment.TemperatureLevel** --- for
    monitoring and controlling the water temperature level
  * **org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Environment.MoistureLevel** --- for
    monitoring and controlling the water moisture level

### Properties

#### CyclePhaseId

|            |                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type       | byte                                                    |
| Access     | read-only                                               |
| Annotation | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = true |

It indicates the current phase identifier of the operational cycle.

The data type is an enumeration; the property values are organized in two
ranges:

  * 0x00-0x7F --- **standard phase id** --- the meanings is shared among
    every appliance supporting the DishWasher interface
  * 0x80-0xFF --- **vendor-defined phase id** --- the meanings depends on
    manufacturer so different appliances can use the same values with different
    meanings

At the moment the list of valid **standard cycle phases** is:

  * 0x00 --- **Unavailable** --- the phase value is not available (no phase is
    selected)
  * 0x01 --- **Pre-washing** --- see
    [Washer and Dryers Theory Of Operation](ClothesWasherAndDryerTheoryOfOperation)
  * 0x02 --- **Washing** --- see
    [Washer and Dryers Theory Of Operation](ClothesWasherAndDryerTheoryOfOperation)
  * 0x03 --- **Rinsing** --- see
    [Washer and Dryers Theory Of Operation](ClothesWasherAndDryerTheoryOfOperation)
  * 0x04 --- **Spinning** --- see
    [Washer and Dryers Theory Of Operation](ClothesWasherAndDryerTheoryOfOperation)
  * 0x05 --- **Steam** --- see
    [Washer and Dryers Theory Of Operation](ClothesWasherAndDryerTheoryOfOperation)
  * 0x06 --- **Drying** --- see
    [Washer and Dryers Theory Of Operation](ClothesWasherAndDryerTheoryOfOperation)
  * 0x07 --- **Cooling** --- see
    [Washer and Dryers Theory Of Operation](ClothesWasherAndDryerTheoryOfOperation)
  * 0x08 --- **AntiCreasing** --- see
    [Washer and Dryers Theory Of Operation](ClothesWasherAndDryerTheoryOfOperation)
  * 0x7F --- **Not Supported** --- the phase value is not communicated to
    _consumer_

If the appliance doesn't implement the functionality of monitoring the phase,
this property is always **Not Supported**.

#### SupportedCyclePhaseIds

|            |                                                          |

| Annotation | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = false |

It lists the values of cycle phase identifiers which are supported by the
appliance. It is used to know in advance and which are the values that the
**CyclePhaseId** can assume.

The elements of the array belongs to the **standard phase id** and
**vendor-defined phase id** ranges. In case there can be only element of one of
the ranges.

If the array is empty the appliance doesn't communicate the cycle phase
identifier value information to the _consumer_.

#### OperationalCycleId

|            |                                                         |

| Annotation | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = true |

It indicates the currently selected operational cycle identifier.

The property values are organized in two ranges:

  * 0x0000-0x7FFF --- **standard cycle id** --- the meanings is shared among
    every appliance supporting the ClothesWasher-Dryer interface; the value 0x7FFF
    means **Not Supported** and it is used when the appliance doesn't
    communicate the property information to the _consumer_
  * 0x8000-0xFFFF --- **vendor-defined cycle id** --- the meanings depends on
    manufacturer so different appliances can use the same values with different
    meanings

At the moment the list of **standard cycle ids** is still under discussion.

**vendor-defined cycle id** ranges. The list can be composed by:

  * both standard and vendor-defined cycle ids
  * only standard cycle ids
  * only vendor-defined cycle ids

If the array is empty the appliance doesn't communicate the operational cycle
identifier value information to the _consumer_.

### Methods

#### GetCyclePhaseIdsInfo (languageTag) -> (info)

Get information about the cycle phases which are supported by the appliance.
It is used to communicate to _consumer_ the names of the vendor-defined cycle
phases supported by the appliance, so they can be available remotely.
In principle standard cycle phases have standards names (in English language)
which are defined at specification level and so this method returns information
only about cycle phases belonging to vendor-defined range [0x80 - 0xFF] of
**CyclePhaseId** propriety.
It is possible the case no information is provided as output (i.e. empty array
is returned).

Input arguments:

  * **languageTag** --- string --- language to be used in the output strings
    using IETF language tags specified by RFC 5646.

Output arguments:

  * **info** --- CyclePhaseInfo[] --- the info list of cycle phases

Errors raised by this method:

  * org.alljoyn.LanguageNotSupported --- the language specified is not supported

#### SetOperationalCycleId (cycleId)

Set the value of operational cycle id.
If the _consumer_ tries to set value which is not supported (i.e. it is not in
the list of **SelectableOperationalCycleIds** property), then a an error should
be returned.

Input arguments:

  * **cycleId** --- int16 --- the operational cycle id value to be set

Errors raised by this method:
  * org.alljoyn.Error.InvalidValue --- if the command value is not one of the
    **SelectableOperationalCycleIds** list
  * org.alljoyn.Error.FeatureNotAvailable --- if the feature mode is not
    supported by the appliance, i.e. the **SelectableOperationalCycleIds** list
    is empty
  * org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.NotAcceptableDueToInternalState --- when the
    command value is not accepted by the _producer_, because it is in a state
    which doesn't allow the execution
  * org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.RemoteControlDisabled --- when the remote
    control is disabled

#### GetOperationalCyclesDescription (languageTag) -> (description)

Get information about the cycle which are supported by the appliance.
It is used to communicate to _consumer_ the names and descriptions of the
proprietary cycles supported by the appliance, so they can be available
remotely.
In principle standard cycles have standards names and descriptions (in English
language) which are defined at specification level and so this method returns
information only about operational cycles belonging to "proprietary" range
[0x8000 - 0xFFFF] of **OperationalCycleId** propriety.

Input arguments:

  * **languageTag** --- string --- language to be used in the output strings
    using IETF language tags specified by RFC 5646.

Output arguments:

  * **description** --- OperationalCycleDescriptor[] --- the list of cycle
    descriptions

Errors raised by this method:

  * org.alljoyn.LanguageNotSupported --- the language specified is not supported

#### SetSpinSpeedLevel (level)

Set the value of spin speed level.
If the _consumer_ tries to set value which is not supported (i.e. it is not in
the list of **SelectableSpinSpeedLevels** property), then an error should be
returned.

Input arguments:

  * **level** --- byte --- the spin speed level value to be set

Errors raised by this method:

  * org.alljoyn.Error.InvalidValue --- if the level value is not one of the

    level value is not accepted by the _producer_, because it is in a state
    which doesn't allow the execution
  * org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.RemoteControlDisabled --- when the remote
    control is disabled

#### GetSpinSpeedLevelInfo (languageTag) -> (info)

Get information about the spin speed levels in string format.
It is used to communicate to _consumer_ the strings associated to the spin speed
level supported values, so it can display them.

Input arguments:

  * **languageTag** --- string --- language to be used in the output strings
  using IETF language tags specified by RFC 5646.

Output arguments:

  * **info** --- string[] --- the list of strings associated to the spin speed
    levels, each element of the array refers to the level expressed by its
    index; the array can be:
      * empty: there are no string to communicate
      * list a string for each element from 0 to **MaxSpinSpeedLevel**
    examples of output are:
      1. "400 RPM", "1000 RPM", "12000 RPM"

    level value is not accepted by the _producer_, because it is in a state
    which doesn't allow the execution
  * org.alljoyn.SmartSpaces.Error.RemoteControlDisabled --- when the remote
    control is disabled

#### GetSoilLevelInfo (languageTag) -> (info)

Get added information about the soil levels in string format.
It is used to communicate to _consumer_ the strings associated to the soil level
supported values, so it can display them.

Input arguments:

  * **languageTag** --- string --- language to be used in the output strings
    using IETF language tags specified by RFC 5646.

Output arguments:

  * **info** --- string[] --- the list of strings associated to the soil levels,
    each element of the array refers to the level expressed by its index; the
    array can be:
      * empty: there are no string to communicate
